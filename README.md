DeFi Trading Agent
Overview
DeFi Trading Agent is an automated trading bot designed to trade cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap. It leverages technical analysis indicators such as SMA (Simple Moving Averages), RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to predict market movements. Additionally, the bot integrates with CrewAI for risk and compliance management, making trading decisions more secure and informed.

The agent also includes portfolio rebalancing logic and supports multiple trading pairs, starting with LINK/ETH. The system can be expanded to trade meme coins and other tokens, offering a flexible, modular architecture.

Key Features
AI-Driven Market Predictions: Uses indicators like SMA, RSI, and MACD to make informed trading decisions.
Risk and Compliance Management: CrewAI integration ensures each trade adheres to risk and compliance thresholds (e.g., liquidity checks, slippage, gas costs).
Stop-Loss & Take-Profit: Automatically closes positions based on predefined profit or loss thresholds.
Portfolio Rebalancing: Ensures the portfolio maintains a target ETH/token ratio.
Supports Multiple Tokens: Initially programmed for LINK/ETH trading but can be adapted for other token pairs (including meme coins).
Gas Buffer Management: Automatically adjusts trades to account for gas fees, preventing insufficient funds errors.
Trade Execution on DEX: Interacts with Uniswap V2 on Sepolia for buy/sell transactions.
